This calculator application might seem like just another basic project, but itâ€™s much more than that. I have been exploring advanced and interesting topics in React, and this project serves as a practical implementation of those concepts.  

I am trying to incorporate as many important and engaging features as possible to make it more than just a simple app.  

This project was sourced from the Frontend Mentor website.

If you want to use then make sure you have nodejs installed.
1. npm install
2. npm run dev

that's it.
